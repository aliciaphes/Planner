Plannie
=======

My final project for BEWD is a planning application where users can manage their day to day activities (create, modify, update them). They can also be deleted but also restored as if a recycling bin existed.

Events can also be marked as private and there is an option in the menu to display all private items.

Another feature is the ability to export the event to Google calendar.
